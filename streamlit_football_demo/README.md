# Streamlit App

A Machine Learning project is never really complete if we don’t have a good way to showcase it.

While in the past, a well-made visualization or a small PPT used to be enough for showcasing a data science project, with the advent of dashboarding tools like RShiny and Dash, a good data scientist needs to have a fair bit of knowledge of web frameworks to get along.

This code is part of my post [How to write Web apps using simple Python for Data Scientists?](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-web-apps-using-simple-python-for-data-scientists-a227a1a01582)

To Run app:

```
streamlit run helloworld.py
```
