Also as it turns out Diaconis was the advisor of Joseph. So you have Bilbo a Thief who goes to Smaug's Lair. He finds M treasures. Each Ring has some Weight and some Gold value. But Bilbo cannot really take all of that. He could only carry a certain Maximum Weight. But being a smart hobbit, he wants to Maximize the value of the treasures he takes. Given the values for weights and value of the treasures and the maximum weight that Bilbo could carry, could you find a good solution? This is known as the Knapsack Problem in Computer Science."

        "Restating, we have Bilbo a Thief who goes to Smaug's Lair. He finds M treasures. Each treasure has some Weight and some Gold value. But Bilbo cannot really take all of that. He could only carry a certain Maximum Weight. But being a smart hobbit, he wants to Maximize the value of the treasures he takes. Given the values for weights and value of the treasures and the maximum weight that Bilbo could carry, could you find a good solution?\n",

If $/beta$ is big we will give very high score to good solutions and the chain will not be able to try new solutions as it can get stuck in local optimas. If we give a small value the chain will not converge to very good solutions. So weuse an Optimization Technique called **Simulated Annealing** i.e. we will start with a small value of $\\beta$ and increase as no of iterations go up.\n",
